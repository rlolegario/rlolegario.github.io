# Hello! 
This is the code that corresponds to my personal website (trentagon.github.io). 
The site uses Jekyll and is hosted by Github Pages. 
The code is based on the gh-pages-template, described below.

# gh-pages-template
A GitHub pages template based on [minimal Jekyll theme.](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)
Couple of additional futures such as a navigation bar and a full page layout are added to the minimal theme.

- [Preview the theme](https://kbsezginel.github.io/gh-pages-template/)
- [See the original theme in action](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/)

## Usage
See [setup and customization instructions](https://kbsezginel.github.io/gh-pages-template/setup) to start using the theme.
