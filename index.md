  Hi, thanks for stopping by and welcome to my page! =)

  I am a dedicated professional with a diverse educational background and a deep passion for the field of neuroscience, particularly its applications in the understanding of human aging.

### **Education and Academic Background**
-----------------------

  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physical Education/Fitness from the [University of Bras√≠lia](https://international.unb.br/) (UnB), providing me with a solid foundation in human physiology and the promotion of physical well-being. Furthermore, I have undergone specialized training in exercise prescription for specific populations, with a particular emphasis on individuals affected by Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This training equips me with the expertise to address the unique needs of these populations and enhance their overall health and quality of life.
  
  Additionally, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [International University Center](https://globalhub.uninter.com/en/), showcasing my proficiency in numerical reasoning and problem-solving. I have a deep interest in applying this mathematical knowledge to clinical research, where precision and data analysis are paramount.

  My academic journey also includes a Master's degree in Behavioral Sciences, with a concentration in Cognition and Behavioral Neurosciences, achieved at the UnB. This experience allowed me to delve deeply into the intricate workings of the human mind and behavior.

### **Current Pursuit: Doctorate in Medical Sciences**
--------------------------

  I am currently pursuing a Doctorate in Medical Sciences, specializing in the field of Medicine, at the UnB. This academic journey uniquely positions me to bridge the gap between neuroscience and medical research, with a particular focus on advancing our understanding of the aging process in humans. What sets my research apart is the integration of my mathematical skills and my expertise in Physical Education/Fitness, gained during my Bachelor's degree. This multidisciplinary approach is especially relevant as I explore the application of physical exercise in clinical settings, working with patients affected by Alzheimer's disease and Cognitive Impairment. My work aims to develop innovative strategies that not only enhance their well-being but also improve cognitive health, contributing to the broader field of medical research.

### **Passion for Neurosciences and Aging**
----------------------------

  My profound interest lies in neurosciences, especially in applying neuroscientific approaches, bolstered by mathematical rigor, to the study of human aging. I believe that understanding the intricacies of the aging brain is crucial for improving the quality of life for older individuals and contributing to the field of geroscience.
