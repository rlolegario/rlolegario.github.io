## About Me

Hi, my name is Trent Thomas. I am an astrobiologist and planetary scientist based in Seattle, Washington.

I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow pursuing a dual-title Ph.D. in Earth and Space Sciences and Astrobiology at the University of Washington, Seattle. I am also a researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. A full list of my credentials can be found in my **[cv](assets/cvs/tthomas_cv.pdf)**.

I use numerical modeling to simulate how planets (e.g., Earth, Mars, exoplanets) evolve over time, which sheds light on the origin and evolution of life, and the search for life elsewhere. I am actively working on scientific research, publishing papers, and presenting at scientific conferences. More information on my research can be found in the **[research](research)** section.

To contact me, send me an email ([tbthomas@uw.edu](mailto:tbthomas@uw.edu)) or reach out on twitter ([@trentag0n](https://twitter.com/trentag0n)). I am happy to speak at events or engage in a wide range of outreach activities.
