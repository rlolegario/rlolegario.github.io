## About Me

![alt text](assets/img/trent_and_renyu.jpg "Trent and Renyu at DPS 2022")

Hi, my name is **Trent Thomas**. I am an **astrobiologist** and **planetary scientist**. 

I am an **NSF Graduate Research Fellow** pursuing a **dual-title Ph.D.** in Earth and Space Sciences and Astrobiology at the **University of Washington, Seattle**. I am also a researcher at **NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory** in Pasadena, California.

To contact me, send me an email ([tbthomas@uw.edu](tbthomas@uw.edu)) or reach out on twitter ([@trentag0n](https://twitter.com/trentag0n)).

## About My Research

**To determine our place in the universe, we must address some important questions:** how did life originate? how did life evolve to its modern state? is there life elsewhere in the universe? Although these questions are challenging, science can help us answer them. 

**The origin of life, the evolution of life, and the distribution of life in the universe are all dependent on planets**. It is thought that the first lifeform on Earth was generated by chemical reactions that occurred under specific conditions present on the ancient Earth. Could other planets provide the same set of conditions to generate life from non-living things? To look for life elsewhere in the universe, we can send spacecraft to other planets in our solar system or we can look at planets outside of our solar system with a telescope. Where should we look? Which planets are most likely to contain extant life? Answering these questions requires a strong understanding of planetary science.

**Every planet is a complex system**. For example, Earth's behavior is a mosaic of interractions between the atmosphere (air), hydrosphere (ocean), geosphere (rocks), and biosphere (life). Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and the other planets in our solar system are all complex systems as well, but with notable differences from Earth. By studying and comparing planets, we gain a stronger understanding of planetary science, which gets us closer to understanding our place in the universe.

**I study how planets function** in our solar system (e.g., Earth, Mars, Venus) and outside of our solar system (exoplanets). I use **numerical modeling** to simulate how planets evolve over time, which sheds light on the origin and evolution of life, and the search for life elsewhere. I am actively working on scientific research, publishing papers, and presenting at scientific conferences.

More information on my research can be found in the **research highlights** section.

## What is Astrobiology?

Astrobiology is the study of the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe. It has been a part of NASA since the 1960's (then called "exobiology") and is the driving force behind many space exploration missions, including the Perseverance rover on Mars and the James Webb Space Telescope.
